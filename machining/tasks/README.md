### Bug Fixes
1. **Timer Reset Issue**: Fixed timer not resetting and start button not becoming active when timer is stopped
2. **Modal Visibility Issue**: Fixed modals not being visible when "ARIZA" or "Manuel" buttons are clicked
3. **CSS Class Management**: Updated modal display logic to use CSS classes for better control
4. **Start Button Disabled Issue**: Fixed start button remaining disabled after stopping timer by:
   - Adding explicit `startBtn.disabled = false` in success case
   - Adding CSS disabled styles for `.timer-btn-primary`
   - Ensuring `disabled` class is removed from button
   - Adding explicit disabled state management in `updateButtonStates`
5. **Modal Blur Issue**: Fixed modal content being blurred by backdrop by:
   - Increasing z-index values for proper layering (overlay: 9999, backdrop: 9998, container: 10000)
   - Ensuring modal container is above backdrop blur effect
   - Maintaining backdrop blur for background while keeping modal crisp
6. **Modal Height Issue**: Fixed buttons not being visible on small screen heights by:
   - Changing modal overflow from `hidden` to `auto` for scrolling
   - Adding flexbox layout to modal container for better content distribution
   - Adding responsive height adjustments for screens under 600px height
   - Ensuring modal footer stays visible with `flex-shrink: 0`
7. **Manual Time Input Improvement**: Combined date and time inputs for better UX by:
   - Replacing separate date and time inputs with datetime-local inputs
   - Updating JavaScript to handle combined datetime values
   - Maintaining real-time duration preview functionality
   - Simplifying form validation and user interaction
8. **Redirect Warning Modal Fix**: Fixed unwanted redirects when closing modal by:
   - Separating close and redirect logic into different functions
   - Only redirecting when user explicitly clicks "Tamam" button
   - Allowing modal to close normally when clicking X or backdrop
   - Moving redirect logic to the calling function for better control
   - Only showing redirect warning when user explicitly clicks "Hayır" in machine status modal
   - Making redirect warning modal forced action (no close button, no backdrop click)
